# CR10SPro2Switchwire
 This project has a goal to convert a stock Creality CR10SPro to become as close as possible to a [Voron Switchwire](https://vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire)

## Motivations
Even before building my Voron 2.4 I wanted to improve my old Creality CR10SPro as much as possible as it served me well for a while. The first (and only at the time) mod I did was to replace the default fans for the controller, electrical bay exhaust and Meanwell power supply. That was a really good mod as it made it bearable to stay in the same room as my printer.

After a while I decided to build a Voron printer (mainly a V2.4) to print ASA/ABS and PETG while my CR10SPro would be tasked with printing TPU and PLA, as I that way I could split my needs between the two prints and tune them well for those specific jobs.

To accomplish this I decided to split this project in steps, that way it would be easier to follow the entire process and/or do small “conversions” as needed, so other people could benefit from this work.

I will keep updating this repository as I progress in this project and will have my work documented in my Youtube channel [Trip’s Cavern](https://www.youtube.com/@tripscavern)
