# CR10SPro2Switchwire
 This project has a goal to convert a stock Creality CR10SPro to become as close as possible to a [Voron Switchwire](https://vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire)

 Although this could be considered a single project, I'm splitting it in very specific steps, this way it's easier to reproduce any part of this project in a future build.
