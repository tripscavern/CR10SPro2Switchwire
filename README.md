# CR10SPro2Switchwire
 This project has a goal to convert a stock Creality CR-10SPro to become as close as possible to a [Voron Switchwire](https://vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire)

## History and Motivations
Back in 2017 I wanted to buy a 3D printer and after some research I ended up choosing a CR-10SPro. The main reason was because of the Auto Bed Leveling, which, at the time, was not a feature that was present in the lower end printers. I though about buying a Prusa, but they were more expensive and I wasn't sure that I could build a kit.
When I got my CR-10SPro it was great, it worked well out-of-the-box but there were 2 things that bothered me a lot: Fan noise and bed adhesion. Bed adhesion was actually the opposite as what most people face, prints were adhering too much and as it wasn't removable, it was a pain to remove anything. So, I ended up getting a WhamBam magnetic spring steel sheet and it became great. But the fans were stupidly loud, and as my printer was at my office, it was almost impossible to keep it running while I was working. I then did the Noctua fan mod, which were the recommendation at the time, and it improved considerably. The other 2 fans (part cooling and extruder) were still loud, but those were more complex to replace, so I just learned how to deal with them.

After almost 3 years without printing anything, I tumbled upon 2 things that would re-kindle my 3D printing itches: Gridfinity and SteveBuilds live-streams. The first was a god-send as I wanted to organize my things, and  watching SteveBuilds live-streams where he was building a Voron 2.4 at the time was both entertaining and gave me confidence to actually build one myself. My first idea was actually to get a Creality Ender 6 and mod it slowly to get near a Voron 2.4, but I ended up getting a Siboor kit for my Voron 2.4 and after building it, I was both happy with the result and wanted more.

Given that my Voron 2.4 would solve all my requirements for high temp material, I didn't want to bother re-adjusting it every time that I wanted to print PLA or TPU, so I started re-purposing my old CR-10SPro. My first idea was to just replace the motherboard and then replace the extruder set by a StealthBurner, but I ended up with this project where I aim to make my CR-10SPro become as close as possible to a Voron Switchwire. My initial idea was to build it in steps, but I ended up thinking that it would be easier to do all at once, and here is where we arrived.

I will be recording my work on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TripsCavern/streams) and will keep a track on all the changes and materials that I needed in this GitHub repository.

## BOM
  
 * You can find the BOM in this link - [BOM CR10SPro Materials](BOM.md)
   * In the STL folder you will find:
   * The original Voron Switchwire files that I printed [here](stl/switchwire)
   * The files that I designed myself to adapt to my build [here](stl/originals)
 
Note that I'm only keeping the Switchwire files here as a way to freeze in time the files that I printed, please look at their main site for updated versions of the same files if you want to print them yourself as these may be outdated.
